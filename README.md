# VRChatEACBypass
A Simple EAC Bypass made for VRChat (Patched as of 31/10/23)
Abuses a vulnerability within EAC EOS to patch the settings.json file with custom productid, sandboxid and deploymentid and reverts them to their original values upon the termination of the "start_protected_game" process.
This used to work for 6 months before it was finally patched.
The code is a mess, I rushed it and couldn't be bothered to clean it up, feel free to do that if you are bored.
Enjoy
